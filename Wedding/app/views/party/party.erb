                <br> <b>Party Member 1</b> <br><div class="about"> We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape-horn? I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! Touché, Pandora. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. <br> </div>
                <b>Party Member 2</b>  <br><div class="about"> That's the first time we were in the shower since our honeymoon. And this time, no tears. When a man needs to prove to a woman that he's actually… When a man loves a woman… Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot… your wife is dead! She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time. Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. What, so the guy we are meeting with can't even grow his own hair? COME ON! Let me take off my assistant's skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-The-Prince-of-Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit. </div> <br>
                <b>Party Member 3</b>  <br><div class="about"> Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog." Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful! OH MY GOD, WE'RE HAVING A FIRE… sale. Oh, the burning! ♪♪ Amaaaaaaziiiing Graaaace ♪♪ And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking. That's not what I WAS thinking. <br> </div>
                <b>Party Member 4</b>  <br><div class="about"> Pound is tic-tac-toe right? First I blow him, then I poke him. Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! <br> </div>
                <b>Party Member 5</b>  <br><div class="about"> I'm not a prostitute. Michael: Then I shall let you live! Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? <br></div>
                <b>Party Member 6</b>  <br><div class="about"> How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces. There are dozens of us! DOZENS! Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. Let me take off my assistant's skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-The-Prince-of-Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit. Heyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. </div>

    <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4"><h1>Groom</h1> 
      <br> <b> Caleb Attwell </b>  <br><div class="about"> Brother from the same Mother. Man about town. The smartest man I know.

              <b> Ross Vedder </b><div class="about"> <br> What can you say about Ross that he hasn't said about himself at length? Ross is driven and drives Sean to do better things. They met in Highschool at a Westlake Dance (they kept things plutonic) Ross loves sitting around a campfire, filling the joke-space and constantly berating Sean. Ross lives in New York City, where he works as a Movie Editor. <br> </div>

I've been in the film business for a while but I just cant seem to get one in the can. I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) <br> </div>
