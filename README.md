============

This is the wedding site for my fiancee and I. It uses use of light custom JQuery work on the RSVP page to toggle the number of inputs based on the number of guests. The RSVP page is the only page to use a full MVC implimentation. Saves guests and their Guests names.

This Project uses the twitter bootstrap, and useragent gem for easy CSS and mobile optimization.
